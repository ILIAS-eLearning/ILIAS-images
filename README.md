# ILIAS-images

This repository contains the master files for the images used in the default
system style of ILIAS. We provide these files as Illustrator files to allow
our users to modify them according to their needs and to make them suitable
to the Corporate Identity of their institution or company.

## Milos Iconset

With ILIAS 8 we have introduced a modified Milos iconset for all images used
in the main bar, in tiles and in page headers. Usually, the name of these 
image files start with "icon_". These images are currently provided in the 
ILIAS directory /templates/default/images. You also find a README.md in 
this directory to inform you about what has to be considered when changing 
the image files for your purposes.
 
Important: when creating a new version of an icon image file and export it
to .svg the file name itself has to be the same as for the original file.
Otherwise, ILIAS won't find the modified file.
