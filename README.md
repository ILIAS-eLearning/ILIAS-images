# ILIAS-images

This repository contains the master files for the images used in the default
 system style of ILIAS. We provide these files as Illustrator files to allow
  our users to modify them according to their needs and to make them suitable
   to the Corporate Identity of their institution or company.

## Milos Iconset

With ILIAS 8 we have introduced a modified Milos iconset for all images used
 in the main bar, in tiles and in page headers. Usually, the name of these 
 image files start with "icon_". These images are currently provided in the 
 ILIAS directory /templates/default/images. You also find a README.md in 
 this directory to inform you about what has to be considered when changing 
 the image files for your purposes.
